### Flappy Bird Clone
A simple Flappy Bird clone made in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) engine.

I was following this guide by [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss):
- [Beginner Godot Tutorial - Make Flappy Bird in 12 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/9f9t9eiCDAA?si=d8JaVoMjiPjb7CPv)

And made a couple of tweaks myself.
